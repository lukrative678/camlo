## Design Rationale

The rebranding from "Seal Solutions Australia" to "CAMLO INDUSTRIES" required a logo that maintains a clear connection to the company's expertise in sealing solutions while elevating the brand to a more premium, international positioning.

This metallic seal design accomplishes these goals by:

- Creating an immediate visual association with high-quality hydraulic seals
- Emphasizing precision engineering and technical expertise
- Using metallic finishes to communicate durability and premium quality
- Incorporating the distinctive gold fluid element that makes the design unique and memorable

The metallic blue and gold color scheme helps position CAMLO INDUSTRIES as a premium provider in the industrial sector, while the clean, modern typography ensures clarity and professionalism. The animated version adds an extra dimension by showing the gold liquid in motion, emphasizing the dynamic performance capabilities of the company's sealing solutions.
