# CAMLO INDUSTRIES Logo Design

## Design Concept

The CAMLO INDUSTRIES logo features a modern industrial design inspired by mechanical engineering elements. The logo combines gear symbols with a wrench tool, representing precision engineering, mechanical expertise, and industrial capability.

## Logo Elements

### Symbol Components

1. **Dual Gears**:
   - Left gear in silver/gray (#d6d6d6) - represents reliability, durability, and precision
   - Right gear in red (#e74c3c) - represents energy, passion, and innovation
   - The interlocking gear design symbolizes synergy and mechanical precision

2. **Wrench**:
   - Centered white wrench symbol overlapping both gears
   - Represents the practical, hands-on engineering capability
   - Creates a visual focal point and ties the gear elements together

### Typography

- **Company Name**: "CAMLO INDUSTRIES" in bold uppercase letters
- **Tagline**: "ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE" in a lighter weight
- **Font**: Clean sans-serif typeface for maximum legibility and modern appearance
- **Color**: The company name uses the same red as the right gear for brand consistency

3. **PNG Version**: Raster format with transparency for digital use

## Design Rationale

The rebranding from "Seal Solutions Australia" to "CAMLO INDUSTRIES" represents a shift to a more international, diversified industrial focus. The new logo communicates:

- Technical expertise and precision engineering
- Modern, forward-thinking approach
- Strong industrial capabilities
- Professional and reliable service

The geometric precision of the gears combined with the clean typography projects an image of a company that values both traditional engineering expertise and modern innovation.
